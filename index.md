In UCSC EdgeLab, we study and build
distributed data management
systems. We are interested in systems that span large geographic
areas and infrastructures, including cloud and edge environments.

We target applications in the edge and IoT domain such as smart
spaces, autonomous cars, and mobile applications.


## EdgeLab Goal: WedgeDB

![WedgeDB](figs/wedgedb.jpg)

*Wide-area Edge DB (WedgeDB)* is a distributed database that span cloud
and edge nodes.  WedgeDB distributes storage and compute resources
close to users to enable fast access. In EdgeLab, we tackle various
research problems to realize WedgeDB. These research problems span
topics such as consensus, byzantine agreement, transaction
processing, and data indexing. Currently, the following are active
projects within the WedgeDB scope.
